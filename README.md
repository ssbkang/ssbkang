### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Steven from New Zealand. I am currently working as a consultant mainly focusing on cloud-native technologies such as Kubernetes. 

Outside of my day to day job, I contribute to [Portainer ](https://github.com/portainer) primarily around CI/CD pipelines for building multi-arch Docker container images. I also write [blogs](https://ssbkang.com) to share my real life experiences in IT.

My primary goal is to share technologies as much as I can. Keep an eye on my work!âœ¨
